[//]: # (# Description)

This course provides a practical introduction to the R programming
language. The material is somewhat adapted to an life scientist
audience and the target audience have an interest in using R for their
data analysis, but there is no need with prior knowledge in R or other
programming languages.

> Before the first lecture, we require you to follow
> these [preliminary steps](preliminary).

# Schedule

From Monday February 6<sup>th</sup>, to Friday February 10<sup>th</sup> 2017 (week 6).

* **09:00 - 12:00**: Lectures + Hands-on (including a Fika break)
* **12.00 - 13:00**: Lunch
* **13:00 - 15:00**: Lectures + Hands-on
* **15:00 - 17:00**: Practice time (with assistants)

# Course Content

During this course, you will learn about:

* The basic data types in R and how to use data structures in
  analysis.
* Different ways to control program flow using loops and conditional tests
* Howto to use R studio to generate reproducible results
* How to download packages that can extend the functions in R
* Reading from and writing to files
* Generate beutiful graphics from suitable data

# Learning Outcomes

After this course you should be able to:

* Write and run R scripts
* Write file-processing python programs that produce output to the terminal and/or external files.
* Create stand-alone python programs to process biological data
* Know how to develop your skills in Python after the course (including debugging)

### Learning objectives (ie goals for the teachers)

* Increase the student's toolbelt for better quality and performance at work
* Make students understand that there is more to programming than only
  _knowing_ the syntax of a language. This expertise is precisely
  what [NBIS](//nbis.se) provides.

# Format

* Presentations and demonstrations
* Practical exercises (either as lab assignments with assistants or on your own).

We do not require you to buy a companion book, as there are already
lots of resources online. However, if you insist, we can
suggest
[_Programming Python_](//shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596158118.do),
[_Learning Python_](//shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028154.do),
or
[_Programming in Python 3_](//www.amazon.com/Programming-Python-Complete-Introduction-Language/dp/0321680561). Such
books can prove useful for your programming tasks, even after the
course is over.

# Location

Lectures and exercises will take place in room `E10:1309` at

[Uppsala Biomedical Centre (BMC), Husargatan 3, SciLifeLab entrance (C11)](//goo.gl/maps/43FaEXxJwK92).
